# SoftwareSerial 

The SoftwareSerial library has been developed to allow serial communication on other digital pins of the Arduino, using software to replicate the functionality (hence the name "SoftwareSerial"). It is possible to have multiple software serial ports with speeds up to 115200 bps. A parameter enables inverted signaling for devices which require that protocol.

The version of SoftwareSerial included in 1.0 and later is based on the NewSoftSerial library by Mikal Hart.
